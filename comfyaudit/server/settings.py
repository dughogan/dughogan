"""Read the studio profile out of ComfyUI's own settings.

A studio profile describes the facility, not the workflow. Territory, revenue
band and what ships are the same on Monday as they were on Friday, and the same
for every graph on the machine - so making someone wire a node into each one
would be asking them to restate a constant.

ComfyUI keeps front-end settings in ``<user dir>/<user>/comfy.settings.json``,
written by the settings dialog. The web extension registers this pack's entries
there; this module reads them back on the Python side, where the audit runs.

Everything here is optional. No ComfyUI, no settings file, or an empty profile
all end the same way: nothing is determined, and the report stays descriptive.
