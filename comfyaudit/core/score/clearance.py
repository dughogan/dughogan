"""Turn licence terms plus a studio's own facts into a determination.

The licence summary describes what the terms say. This decides what they mean
*for one particular studio*, which is the only level at which "can we use this?"
has an answer at all: MiniMax H3 is a no in London and a yes in Toronto, because
the licence carves out the United Kingdom by territory and says nothing about
Canada. Nothing here encodes a policy or a risk appetite. It applies stated
terms to stated facts and shows the chain it followed, so a reader can check the
reasoning rather than trust the label.

With no profile supplied, no determination is made. A verdict against an unknown
studio would be a guess wearing a verdict's clothes.

The structured terms it reads live under ``conditions`` on each licence
definition in ``knowledge/data/licences.json``:

``territory_excluded``      list of territory codes the grant does not cover
``revenue_cap_usd``         free use ends above this annual revenue
``monthly_active_users_cap`` free use ends above this MAU count
``copyleft_reach``          none | model-only | integration | network
``outputs_commercial``      whether the restriction reaches the outputs too
``no_competing_training``   outputs may not train a competing model
``attribution_visible``     text that must appear in a shipped product
``commercial_licence_available`` a paid licence exists that lifts the terms
``separate_licence_holder`` who to go to for it
``prohibited_uses``         a use schedule travels with the weights
``hosted``                  runs on someone else's servers
