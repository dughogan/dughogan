"""ComfyUI nodes.

The headline node audits the very graph it is sitting in: ComfyUI hands any node
that asks for them the running prompt and the UI workflow through hidden inputs,
so dropping the node in and hitting Run produces an audit of that workflow with
nothing to configure.

An ``AUDIT`` object is passed between nodes rather than a JSON string, so the
report is parsed once and every downstream node sees the same thing.
